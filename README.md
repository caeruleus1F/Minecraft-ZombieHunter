# Minecraft-ZombieHunter
Using a Minecraft server, simulates a coding challenge I picked up from a reddit forum.

Zombie Hunter is a simulation whereby there is a square grid of user-defined size and entities on the grid that are either zombies, hunters, or victims. zombies can move in the four cardinal directions, while hunters and victims can also move diagonally. Victims only move if there is a zombie in an adjacent tile. Both zombies and hunters wander around the grid randomly, one move per turn. If a victim moves to a tile next to a zombie, the victim becomes a zombie as well. Hunters can kill up to 2 zombies per turn. If 1 or 2 zombies move next to a hunter, the zombies are killed and removed from the grid. If 3 zombies move next to a hunter, 2 of the zombie may die, but the 3rd converts the hunter to another zombie. The simulation ends when there are no more zombies, or when there are no more hunters or victims.  Normally this simulation takes place inside of a for-loop, but in order to display the simulation properly in the Minecraft world, each iteration starts when the player clicks their left mouse button. Zombies are represented with Redstone blocks, Hunters with Emerald blocks, and Victims with Gold blocks.
